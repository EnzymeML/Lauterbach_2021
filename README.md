# This repository accompanies the paper Lauterbach 2021
The folder structure follows the structure of the paper.  
Here you can find all data and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Using the Jupyter Notebooks
#### With Binder
You can use Binder to run the Jupyter Notebooks online, by clicking on this badge:  
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/EnzymeML/Lauterbach_2021.git/HEAD)  
(NOTE: you will be directed to Binder, this will not open a new tab! You can use right-click -> `Open in new Tab`)  
  
This will start a JupyterLab session in your browser.  
On the left you find the folder structure. Double-click on the folder you want to open, e.g. Scenario6. The Jupyter Notebooks have a small orange image icon. Double-click on the notebook you want to run.  
Now you can interact with the notebook. To run all cells click the icon with the two arrows, left of `Download`, and click on Restart in the popup.  
Each cell will automatically run from top to bottom. When a code cell was run a number appears in the brackets on the left.  

#### With google Colaboratory
Instead of Binder you can use google Colaboratory (Colab) to run a Jupyter Notebook.
Each notebook prepared to run in Colab has a Colab badge which looks like this:  
![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)  
Clicking on the badge will redirect you to google Colab.  
To run the notebook select `Runtime`->`Run all` or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+F9`.
